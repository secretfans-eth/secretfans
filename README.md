# generate random encryption key for NFT

# for every public key (derived from ethereum addresses of subscribers) we will use it to encrypt the CEK to give each subscriber a unique ECEK 

# each ECEK will be stored as a hash that is pointed to by the merkel tree of public keys 

# the merkel root will be checked (state check) # noir-app
# sf-zkp
